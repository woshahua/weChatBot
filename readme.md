### current problems
##### OnMessage Func
- it likes each time you send a message, this function is called
- the problem is that I want some kind of mode, like if you type "robot" you talke with robot and type "todo" then into a task mange mode.
- but currently, you can't get into a mode, each time you send a message it will handle like the same, so there is no mode.
